  EXT_INT Generated Driver File 

  @Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  @File Name:
    ext_int.c

  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the EXT_INT 
    driver using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description:
    This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for EXT_INT. 
    Generation Information : 
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.95-b-SNAPSHOT
        Device            :  PIC24FJ64GB002
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.36
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v5.10
